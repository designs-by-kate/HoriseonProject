## Description

Horiseon is a website that showcases digital marketing solutions, including search engine optimization, online reputation management, social media marketing, lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. The codebase follows accessibility standards, ensuring the site is optimized for search engines.

## Features

- Groups related content within appropriate containers.
- Maintains a logical hierarchy for heading elements.
- Removes classes (`float-left` and `float-right`) from HTML for styling, relocating them to the CSS code.
